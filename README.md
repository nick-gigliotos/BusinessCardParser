This program reads in data from text files, and parses that data for a name, phone number, and email of 
the person in the text file. It requires a Java Virtual Machine to be installed on the computer in order to run.

How to build:

The BusinessCardParser.java file contains the main function. To build, open the command line to the file location
and compile with the command "javac BusinessCardParser.java"

To run the program type "java BusinessCardParser" and you will be prompted to enter a file name. Enter the name
of whatever text file you would like parse including the extention of the file. 

For example, the file test1_Mike_Smith.txt would be entered as test1_Mike_Smith.txt

The program will then output the name, phone number, and email it had parsed from the text file. Any value of
"Unknown" means that for that particular attribute, a value was not found.

Thank you for using this program!
